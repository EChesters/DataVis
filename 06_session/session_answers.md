## 2. Direct and Indirect Interaction

Consider direct (interacting with marks) and indirect (interacting via buttons, sliders, drop-down lists etc.) interaction and list the advantages and disadvantages of each by amending / adding to the two tables below. After initially filling the tables, discuss with a neighbour in the lab session, adding any additional advantages/disadvantages that arise from the discussion.

#### Direct Interaction

| Advantages                         | Disadvantages                                 |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| zooming and panning more intuitive | difficult to select densely positioned marks  |
| sliders are common interactions    | requires accuracy and defined range of slider |
| encourages engagement with data    | Increases cognitive load                      |

#### Indirect Interaction

| Advantages                                  | Disadvantages            |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------- |
| Can select non position-encoded data ranges | Increases cognitive load |
| xxx                                         | xxx                      |
| etc.                                        | etc.                     |
